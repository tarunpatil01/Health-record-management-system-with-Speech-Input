The creation of HealthX shows how PHR systems could give patients autonomy, allowing them to manage their health information with unobstructed, safe, and all-encompassing browser-based tools. User engagement with the system has been greatly enhanced by the inclusion of cutting-edge features including speech input, a chatbot, and emergency information, thus allowing it to deliver health satisfaction more responsively and efficiently. This platform is able to assure data privacy and security yet still provide a seamless and ready-to-use experience for the patient. With HealthX, this new way of patient empowerment on health management is in tune with the ever-changing digital healthcare landscape.</br>
